# Pillar-Kata

In order to run this program, copy the source directory to create a local repository.
Once created, from the command line, cd into the Pillar-Kata directory.
Once there, type in java -jar Pillar-Kata-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
From here you can see the output of two different test files I made or input a path to a separate test file you may have locally.

ALTERNATE: 
You could also import the Maven project into an IDE and run the program from there.
